# LocalMarket: E-commerce System Using Prompts and Local Storage

LocalMarket is a simple e-commerce system built using prompts for user interaction and local storage for data persistence. It allows users to browse products, add them to their shopping carts, make orders, and more, all through a command-line-like interface.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can log in with their email and password or sign up for a new account.
- **User Roles**: Supports both regular users and admin users with different access levels.
- **Product Management**: Admin users can add, edit, and delete products from the store.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add products to their shopping carts, view their cart contents, and make orders.
- **Order History**: Users can view their past order history, including details of each order.

## Usage

To use the system, simply run the `system()` function in your browser's console or in a JavaScript environment that supports prompts and local storage. You'll be prompted to log in or sign up, and then you can start interacting with the system based on your user role.
